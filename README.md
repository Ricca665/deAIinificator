this tool tries to apply patches to block AI stuff
currently implemented stuff:

- [x] Block AI websites and APIs


# How does this work
this tool uses the [Hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), and what you can do is use this syntax to block ANY network request to anything you like by rerouting it to 127.0.0.1 (aka your pc)

please suggest a better description for this i don't know what to write
